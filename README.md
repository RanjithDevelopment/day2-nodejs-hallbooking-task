=> To get the rooms available Details I have written a get request in https://hallbooking-api-services.onrender.com


=>  We can create a room with https://hallbooking-api-services.onrender.com/create-room

Sample Body for Creating API :-





{

     
        "name": "medium",
        "seats": 50,
        "roomid": 102,
        "amenities": [
            "internet_access",
            "food",
            "ac",
            "tv"
        ],
        "price": 500,
        "BookingStatus": "Available",
        "customerDetails": {
            "cutstomerName": "",
            "date": "",
            "start": "",
            "end": "",
            "roomId": ""
       
       }
    }
